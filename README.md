# THE OVERALL IDEA:

Look at past standings and goals for different teams in the premier league to identify future winners of the matchups for the upcoming season. Combine these values together to find the overall winner of the league. Besides the winner projections, we can analyze the goals scored, along with the shot percentages from player shooting stats.

We can use machine learning to create logarithmic or linear regression models to pridict who will win in certain matchups throughout this year and in the future.
